# Python_project
This project was aimed at unraveling the sales patterns of an online grocery shop. The tasks covered in this project were mainly focused on exploratory data analysis to gain more insights and provide strategies to target customers. As the final step, based on the analysis of the grocery store data, some recommendations were proposed.  
Several analyses were performed in Python, and all the data, scripts, visualizations, and the final report are available.

The project was organized into five folders to ensure easy access to the desired dataset, scripts, visualizations, and reports:

## 01_Project_management
This [folder](01_Project_management) contains a PDF file with the project description and goals, along with an Excel file template for the final report.

## 02_Data
This [folder](02_Data) contains two subfolders: one with the original data and one with prepared data.

## 03_Scripts
In this [folder](03_Scripts), all Python scripts used to analyze the data are gathered. All of them are saved as Jupyter Notebooks.

## 04_Analysis
[Here](04_Analysis), all the visualizations of the data are gathered, along with a JSON report file.

## 05_Sent_to_client
This [folder](05_Sent_to_client) contains the final report in Excel format.
